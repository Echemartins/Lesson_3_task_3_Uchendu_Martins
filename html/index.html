                        <h1>The Future of Fitness</h1>
                        <p>
                            It’s January and you’re coming into the new year with high hopes and a wealth of enthusiasm that you’ll 
                            finally get your sh*t together. For most of us, the Man of Many team included, that means the same, old
                            formula of meal prepping, diet planning and goal setting, but like all good things, the fitness industry
                            is in a state of constant evolution. The way we trained last year won’t be the way we find our fix in 
                            2021, and hopefully, that’s a good thing. Here’s everything you need to know about the fitness trends that 
                            will shape 2021.

                        <h1>Trends in Fitness</h1>
                        <p>To accurately look forward, you should really start by looking back. The year 2020 was one fraught with 
                            uncertainty and unavailability, two things that surely put a dent in your fitness dreams. With gyms closed and 
                            livelihoods at risk, health took a backseat, but not anymore. “The shutdowns and challenges the fitness industry 
                            has endured in 2020 have paved the way for large-scale technology disruptors and major evolutions in fitness 
                            offerings,” Australian Institute of Fitness (AIF) CEO, Steve Pettit said. “Necessity is the mother of invention, 
                            and as we’ve seen our social needs change, fitness professionals and consumers alike have embraced new fitness 
                            technologies and training models, and reconsidered the role that fitness plays in broader health and everyday lives.”

                        <h1>Fitness Trends in 2021</h1>
                        <p>In fact, the AIF recently released its top 10 Australian fitness trend predictions for 2021 – forecasting the movements, 
                            methods and zeitgeists set to take Australia’s fitness industry forward. Here are the 2021 fitness trends you need to know about.

                                <h2>Wearable Technology</h2>
                                <p>By far the biggest advancement we’re expecting to see in 2021 is the rise of wearable technology in the fitness space. 
                                    Fitness trackers have become essential items for those addicted to health, providing a lot more detail and insights 
                                    than just counting your steps and calories. “Wearable technology has come a long way in a relatively short space of 
                                    time and, these days, everyone from young kids to grannies are wearing devices to monitor their steps, sleep, heart 
                                    rate and more,” Pettit said. “For some Australians, the personalised data and insights from wearables have a novelty 
                                    element – but for many others, wearable data is increasingly being used as a valuable tool to shape and track fitness, 
                                    health and wellness progress.” “Apple and Garmin wearables will continue to flourish across all segments of the Australian 
                                    fitness market in 2021 – from everyday fitness and leisure consumers, through to gym junkies and fitness professionals in 
                                    areas of programming, training and recovery.”
                                </p>

                                <h2>Fitness Is Medicine</h2>
                                <p>Secondly, 2021 is likely to see the continuation of exercise as a medicine. Following the imposed lockdowns of 2020, 
                                    Aussies learned the value of getting active, both physically and mentally. It’s a fitness trend that may be even bigger 
                                    in the new year.
                                    “There is significant collective work to be done on the road to recovery and, with such, we expect to see an increasing 
                                    emphasis on proactive referral and collaboration between medical professionals, health care providers and fitness professionals.”
                                </p>

                            <li>

                                <h2>Mind and Body training</h2>
                                <p>Further to that point, the gap between mental and physical health is expected to shrink as Aussies become more acutely aware of 
                                    the overall health benefits of holistic training.
                                    The fitness trends for yoga, Pilates, breathing work, mindfulness, meditation and broader mental health training have 
                                    intensified during the pandemic, with more people opting for combined training that involves both mind relaxation and physical 
                                    fitness,” Mind and Body Training, AIF’s Head of Training, Kate Kraschnefski said. “This collective training approach will 
                                    continue to increase in popularity in 2021, as mass fitness consumers place dual value on physical and psychological health.”

                                <h2>Virtual exercises</h2>
                                <p>Last year marked a huge turn towards virtual fitness. For the first time, we saw health fanatics hosting Zoom session and personal 
                                    trainers performing work-outs via video chat. With the return to face-to-face contact likely to be a slow and steady approach, virtual 
                                    training will remain a massive component to health in 2021.
                                    “Virtual fitness has been emerging for a while now – however, 2020 has seen an explosion in this area in line with the increased need 
                                    to train at home. Consumers were forced to go virtual and many discovered they liked it – as did many of the professionals delivering 
                                    the programs,” Kraschnefski said.“Many fitness professionals and consumers will continue to return to on-site gyms in 2021; others 
                                    will continue to take up virtual options – especially as additional virtual tech disruptors enter the market and widen choice 
                                    further. Mobile apps, online on-demand workout libraries and virtual PT training will continue to be massive and broaden our 
                                    horizons.”

                                <h2>Outdoor Activities</h2>
                                <img class="img" src="../Image/Outdoor_Activities.jfif" alt="Outdoor_Activities">
                                <p>As with group training, the need to get outside and exercise is something we’ve all be lacking. Even if gyms remain
                                    closed, the ability to hit the park for an outdoor session will be a major drawcard in 2021. Make the most of the 
                                    environment around you and you will be far more motivated to keep up the pace.
